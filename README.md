# Hack4Impact-UMD Technical Application Assessment - Fall 2024

This is a [React](https://react.dev/) web app displaying Pokémon information using the [PokéApi](https://pokeapi.co/). Similar to a Pokedex in Pokémon, this app will allow users to search for a Pokémon, by name, and the statistics associated with the Pokémon are shown along with an image in the form of a [Pokémon card](https://www.pokemon.com/static-assets/content-assets/cms2/img/cards/web/BWP/BWP_EN_BW33.png).
